\section*{Acknowledgements}
This work could not have been possible without the great help of my thesis supervisors Steen H Hansen and Martin Sparre. Martin has been a solid support for programming issues along the way. I believe Steen must be one of the very few supervisors who will respond to technical questions over email even late in the evening.
It has been very rewarding to work under Steen's skilled supervision as the project took several interesting directions along the way.
I am in much gratitude to the people at Dark Cosmology Center for advise and fruitful conversations.
Thanks to my family and friends for all their support. This has been a wonderful appetizer for digging further into the realms of astrophysics. \\ \\
