\section{run0_param}

Below is shown the content of the first parameter file. Of most interest in this present work is the G-value, the softening value and the number of timesteps. Other interesting quantities can be varied as well, such as the energy densities of the different contents of our universe, the Hubble parameter, gas temperatures etc.
