\section{Datafiles for comparison}
The below datafiles serve as a means of comparison. They are datasets from G-perturbation simulations, run with the GADGET-2 code. \\

OMG00\_001\_IC\_000.hdf5 (Osipkov-Merritt, initial conditions) \\
OMG20\_Final\_000.hdf5 (Osipkov-Merritt, final conditions) \\
0G00\_IC\_000.hdf5 ($\beta = 0$, Initial conditions, after zero G-perturbations) \\
0G20\_Final\_000.hdf5 ($ \beta = 0 $, Final structure, after twenty G-perturbations) \\
ICS\_10mpc\_res256\_022.hdf5 (low resolution cosmological simulation inside Newtonian box with size-scale 10 Mpc) \\
ics\_10MPC\_128\_022.hdf5 (high resolution cosmological simulation inside Newtonian box with size-scale 10 Mpc) \\
