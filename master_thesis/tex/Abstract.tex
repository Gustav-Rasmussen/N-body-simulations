\section*{Abstract}
Whether or not the precise structure of each individual virialized DM halo in the universe today is sharply dictated by the laws of nature or a product of random mergers and collisions throughout the formation history of the universe is unknown [16].
In this sense it could be either random or determined by physics. Randomness is favored if all structures look different but physics is the fundamental driving of today's structures if we can observe common trends and universalities. This is the fundamental question being addressed. This work investigates universalities of spherical dark matter structures in equilibrium by the study of collisionless N-body systems. These systems are simulated numerically in a controlled way using the N-body code GADGET-2. The equilibrium structures are generated using Eddingtons inversion method and Osipkov-Merritt models by the means of two C-codes developed by Sparre (see [1] and [2]). Four side projects are carried out as well and can be seen in Appendix B. They address related questions, e.g. morphology of cosmological dark matter halos, how particle velocities are distributed throughout DM structures, comparison of simulated and observable quantities and finally looking for universal features in the rate of change of density profiles for different structures.
