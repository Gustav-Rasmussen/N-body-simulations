# N-body-simulations

INITIAL CONDITIONS:<br/>
C-codes for Eddington and Osipkov-Merritt structures, provided by Martin Sparre<br/>
Density profiles:<br/>
Hernquist and Tsallis q-fit<br/>
SIMULATIONS:<br/>
Performed with GADGET-2.<br/>
TYPES:<br/>
G-perturbations<br/>
Energy-perturbations<br/>
ANALYSIS:<br/>
Python algorithms<br/>
Binning:<br/>
Radial bins<br/>
velocity bins<br/>
Mass bins (implemented as number bins)<br/>
Goal for project:<br/>
Reproduce the Dark matter attractor shown by Steen Hansen et. al.<br/>
Status:<br/>
Attractor has been identified, identical to that of Steen Hansen et. al., a new attractor is also found.
