# N-body-simulations

INITIAL CONDITIONS:

C-codes for Eddington and Osipkov-Merritt structures, provided by Martin Sparre


Density profiles: 

Hernquist and Tsallis q-fit


SIMULATIONS:

Performed with GADGET-2.


TYPES:

G-perturbations
Energy-perturbations


ANALYSIS:

Python algorithms


Binning:

Radial bins

velocity bins

Mass bins (implemented as number bins)


Goal for project:

Reproduce the Dark matter attractor shown by Steen Hansen et. al.


Status:

Attractor has been identified, identical to that of Steen Hansen et. al., a new attractor is also found.
